Then you will put these functions together to compare the effectiveness of various pretrained models for your hot-dog detection program.\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nWe want to distinguish whether an image is a hot dog or not. But our models classify pictures into 1000 different categories. Write a function that takes the models predictions (in the same format as `preds` from the set-up code) and returns a list of `True` and `False` values.\n\nSome tips:\n- Work iteratively. Figure out one line at a time outsie the function, and print that line's output to make sure it's right. Once you have all the code you need, move it into the function `is_hot_dog`. If you get an error, check that you have copied the right code and haven't left anything out.\n- The raw data we loaded in `img_paths` had two images of hot dogs, followed by two images of other foods. So, if you run your function on `preds`, which represents the output of the model on these images, your function should return `[True, True, False, False]`.\n- You will want to use the `decode_predictions` function that was also used in the code provided above.
